      Im Cole Saunders, a first year CS student from Atlanta GA. Im a big runner hiker  reader (especially of epic fantasy), and lover of all things lego. (Steven Erikson, Brandon Sanderson and Robin Hobb are probaly my favorite fantasy authors)
      My go to fun fact (probaly from here on out) is that  this past summer I hiked 500 miles across northern Spain as a part of the Camino an old pilgrimage route which attracts hunderes of thousands of hikers a year.
      I find web devlopment a really cool facet of Computer Science and a hoping to learn more as a part of Bbits of Good as a developer or as a part of the boot camp. Ive  had a good bit but not a ton of experience through several personal projects using python flask and even last year worked with a freind to build a website to track paid time off requests for my local elementry school.
